# INSTRUCTIONS FOR PORT STATE CONTROL REPORT OF INSPECTION FORM B (CG-5437B)

The Port State Control Report of Inspection - FORM B is intended to accompany the Port State Control Report of Inspection - FORM A and provide documentation to the various parties associated with a foreign vessel and other port States on the outcome of a Port State Control (PSC) examination conducted by the U.S. Coast Guard. A Report of Inspection - FORM B shall be completed for all foreign vessel exam types when deficiencies have been identified. The FORM B shall be signed by both the PSCO leading the exam and the master/vessel representative.

## GENERAL

1) All dates should be written in mm/dd/yyyy format.

2) Ensure the MISLE Activity Number is entered in the upper right corner before issuing the Form.

3) The Exam Type should be the same as the exam type entered on the Form A.

**Blocks 1-5:** Shall be the same information that is included on the Form A.

**Block 6** - Complete all columns for each deficiency listed. Use the current list of deficiency codes provided by CG-CVC and group them by order of severity in the "Action Taken" column using the "Action taken Codes" on the bottom of the Form B (i.e. Code 20, 25, and 30 items first, Code 17 items next, etc.). The current list of deficiency codes is available on the Marine Inspector Resource Page on the CGPortal.

Copies should be provided to the vessel, flag state, Recognized Organization (RO), and/or Recognized Security Organization (RSO) only after it has been signed by the Master or vessel representative and the PSCO leading the exam.

In the event of a detention, expulsion, or denial of entry; provide a copy (fax or email) of Forms A and B to the flag State, owner/operator/charterer, RO, and RSO as applicable after the supervisor has reviewed and signed the forms. Include the scanned forms in MISLE under the Documents tab and email them to CG-CVC-2 at portstatecontrol@uscg.mil with the return receipt option checked. Include a comment in the email if more than one major control action was applied (i.e. detained, expelled, denied entry). Also specify the number of Coast Guard issued detentions the vessel has had over the last 12 months.

## DEFICIENCY WRITING

For all deficiencies the description of the deficiency must be a direct and succinct statement that shall contain two important elements:

1) The standard the ship does not meet;

2) A description of why the ship does not meet the standard.

## DEFICIENCY ASSIGNED A CODE 20, 25, OR 30

The report must clearly articulate the reasons for detaining, expelling from port, or denying entry to port a substandard vessel for maritime security, safety, and environmental compliance deficiencies. To accomplish this, the report must outline a deficiency description that shows substandard conditions and list appropriate authority under the international conventions for each deficiency to support the action taken.

Since this form aligns with international standards, IMO convention cites shall have first priority on the Form B. CFR cites should not be used in lieu of IMO convention cites and when necessary, they should be used sparingly. If a vessel violates applicable domestic regulations, COTP authority/procedures should be used as appropriate (restrict cargo ops, detain, deny entry, or expel from port, etc.) and a NOV or civil penalty should be processed.
